Our project will be a variation of Asteroids

Directions: Copy and paste the code from FINALCODE.txt into Processing and run.

What works: Moving the ship, shooting, asteroid collision, world wrapping

What doesn't: FIXED **Shooting when the cursor is to the left of the ship *** FIXED
  Procesing actually used radians not degrees.

What it should do: Shoots bullets when you click/hold, ship moves with WASD, can wrap around the world, bullets and asteroids disappear when they make contact, asteroids respawn somewhere random
